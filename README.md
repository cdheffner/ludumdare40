# Setup
You'll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:
## 2. Install node.js and npm:
## 3. Install dependencies (optionally you can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):
Run:
```npm install``` 
or if you chose yarn, just run ```yarn```
## 4. Run the development server:
Run:

```npm run dev```
## Build for deployment:
Run:
```npm run deploy```
This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
